## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This System Requirements Specification (SRS) provides a detailed description of the system requirements for Call Commander, derived from an in-depth analysis of the Business Requirements Document (BRD). The SRS translates the high-level business needs into technical specifications, including functional behaviors, non-functional attributes, interfaces, and supporting artifacts like use cases and data models. It serves as a blueprint for developers, testers, and architects to ensure the system meets the business objectives of unifying communication systems for multi-location retailers.

### 1.2 Scope

The SRS covers the software requirements for a SaaS-based unified communications platform. It includes:

- Integration of disparate phone systems, software tools, and workflows into a single dashboard.
- Core functionalities: Instant customer data synchronization, intelligent call routing, automation of common requests, and real-time analytics.
- Support for multi-location retailers and franchises with $5M+ ARR.

Exclusions remain as per BRD: No custom hardware, advanced AI beyond basics, or international localization.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **ARR**: Annual Recurring Revenue
- **CRM**: Customer Relationship Management
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **UI**: User Interface
- **UX**: User Experience
- **KPI**: Key Performance Indicator
- **SaaS**: Software as a Service
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control

### 1.4 References

- Business Requirements Document (BRD) v1.0
- IEEE Std 830-1998 (Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications)

### 1.5 Overview

This document is structured to first provide an overall description of the product, followed by specific requirements, and concludes with supporting information to aid implementation.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Call Commander addresses the fragmentation in communication systems across multi-location retail environments. It builds on existing tools by providing a centralized dashboard, reducing operational chaos and enabling focus on customer service. This positions it as an enterprise-grade solution without the complexity, differentiating from fragmented alternatives.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The system will:

- Integrate and unify communication channels.
- Synchronize data in real-time.
- Route calls based on dynamic criteria.
- Automate routine tasks.
- Deliver analytics for performance monitoring.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

- **Store Managers/Staff**: Frequent users; need intuitive, mobile-friendly access; moderate technical skills.
- **Business Owners/Executives**: Occasional users; focus on analytics; high-level oversight.
- **IT Administrators**: Setup and maintenance; advanced technical skills.
- **End Customers**: Indirect; benefit from improved service efficiency.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

- **Hardware**: Standard web browsers on desktops, laptops, or mobile devices.
- **Software**: Web-based (HTML5, JavaScript); compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- **Network**: Internet connection with minimum 10 Mbps bandwidth.
- **Deployment**: Cloud-hosted (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalability.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

- Use RESTful APIs for integrations.
- Adhere to web standards (e.g., WCAG for accessibility).
- Implement in scalable languages/frameworks (e.g., Python/Django or Node.js for backend; React for frontend).
- Ensure compatibility with common retail APIs (e.g., Shopify, Twilio).

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

As per BRD: Internet connectivity, API-compatible systems, stable regulatory environment. Dependencies include third-party services for telephony (e.g., Twilio) and cloud infrastructure.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 External Interfaces

- **User Interfaces**: Responsive web dashboard with mobile optimization; support for login screens, data views, and analytics charts.
- **Hardware Interfaces**: None (software-only).
- **Software Interfaces**:
  - APIs for phone systems (e.g., incoming/outgoing calls via Webhooks).
  - Integration with CRM/inventory tools (e.g., bidirectional sync with Salesforce REST API).
- **Communication Interfaces**: HTTPS for secure data transfer; WebSockets for real-time updates.

### 3.2 Functional Requirements

Expanded from BRD with detailed specifications, including inputs, outputs, and error handling.

  - Flow: 1. Update customer record at Location A. 2. System syncs to all locations. 3. Confirm sync via dashboard.
  - Postconditions: Data consistent across sites.
  - Exceptions: Network failure → Queue and retry.

- **Use Case 2: Intelligent Call Routing**

  - Actors: Incoming Caller, Staff
  - Preconditions: Call received.
  - Flow: 1. Analyze caller needs. 2. Check staff availability/expertise. 3. Route call. 4. Log in analytics.

Additional use cases can be expanded as needed.

### 4.2 Data Model

High-level entity-relationship model:

- **Entities**:
  - User (ID, Role, Location)
  - Customer (ID, Name, History, LocationData)
  - Call (ID, Timestamp, Status, RoutedTo)
  - Metric (ID, Type, Value, Timestamp)
- **Relationships**:
  - User 1:M Call (handles)
  - Customer 1:M Call (involves)
  - Location 1:M User (assigned)

Use ER diagrams in design phase (e.g., via tools like Lucidchart).

### 4.3 Process Flows

- **High-Level Flow for Call Handling**:
  1. Incoming Call → 2. Authenticate/Source Data → 3. Route Intelligently → 4. Automate if Applicable → 5. Log Analytics.
- **Data Sync Flow**:
  1. Data Change Event → 2. Broadcast via API → 3. Update Remote Databases → 4. Acknowledge Success.

## 5. Appendices

- **Traceability Matrix**: Maps SRS reqs to BRD (e.g., FR-01 traces to BRD FR-01).
- **Open Issues**: None identified; to be tracked in project management tool.

This SRS is derived from a thorough analysis of the BRD, ensuring traceability and completeness. No additional documents (e.g., separate FRD) are necessary at this stage, as the SRS incorporates detailed functional specs. If further clarification is needed (e.g., on specific integrations), please provide details. Otherwise, we can proceed to the next steps like design or prototyping.
