## 1. Executive Summary

Call Commander is a unified communications platform designed to address the challenges faced by multi-location retailers and franchises with annual recurring revenue (ARR) exceeding $5 million. These businesses often struggle with fragmented phone systems, software tools, and workflows across locations, leading to inefficiencies in customer service and operational management.

The platform provides a single dashboard that integrates all communication systems, enabling instant customer data synchronization, intelligent call routing, automation of routine tasks, and real-time analytics. This eliminates the need for juggling multiple platforms or dealing with complicated setups, allowing store managers to focus on customers and sales.

This BRD outlines the detailed requirements to guide the development and implementation of Call Commander based on the specified business needs.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Purpose

The purpose of this BRD is to document the business needs, functional and non-functional requirements, and strategic considerations for developing Call Commander. It serves as a foundational document for stakeholders, including product managers, developers, and executives, to ensure alignment on the platform's vision and execution.

### 2.2 Scope

- **In Scope**:

  - Development of a unified dashboard for integrating multi-location communication systems.
  - Core features: Data synchronization, intelligent call routing, automation of common requests, and real-time analytics.
  - Target user base: Multi-location retailers and franchises ($5M+ ARR).

- **Out of Scope**:
  - Custom hardware integrations (e.g., physical phone systems beyond API connections).
  - Advanced AI features beyond specified automation (e.g., predictive analytics or natural language processing for calls).
  - International localization (e.g., multi-language support or region-specific compliance beyond US standards).

### 2.3 Business Objectives

- Solve communication fragmentation for multi-location retailers, allowing store managers to focus on customers and sales.
- Provide a unified dashboard to connect disparate communication systems without complicated setups.
- Ensure consistent customer service across locations through data synchronization, intelligent routing, automation, and analytics.

### 2.4 Project Background

Multi-location retailers and franchises face significant operational inefficiencies due to disparate communication tools. Each location may use different phone systems, software tools, and workflows, resulting in wasted time, inconsistent data, and poor customer experiences. Call Commander addresses this by providing a unified platform that integrates these systems seamlessly.
