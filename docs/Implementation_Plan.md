# Implementation Plan for Unified Call Commander

## Document Information

- **Project Name**: Call Commander - Unified Communications Platform for Multi-Location Retailers
- **Document Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: September 06, 2025
- **Prepared By**: Cascade (AI Assistant)
- **Reference Documents**: BRD v1.0, SRS v1.0, HLD v1.0, LLD v2.0

## Project Overview

Call Commander is a SaaS platform designed to unify communication systems for multi-location retail chains ($5M+ ARR). It addresses fragmentation in phone systems, tools, and workflows by providing a single dashboard with features like instant data synchronization, intelligent call routing, automation of routine tasks (e.g., inventory checks via APIs), and real-time analytics. The system supports scalability for 500+ locations, with a focus on usability, security (GDPR/PCI-DSS compliant), and low-latency operations (<2s for key actions).

### Key Stakeholders and Requirements

- **End Users**: Store managers/staff (intuitive, mobile-friendly access); executives (analytics focus).
- **Core Features** (High Priority): Unified dashboard, data sync, intelligent routing, automation, analytics, authentication/RBAC.
- **Non-Functional**: 99.9% uptime, scalability, security, usability (95% task completion in tests).
- **Exclusions**: No custom hardware, advanced AI beyond basics, international localization.

### Technology Stack (from HLD/LLD)

- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI (MUI) for consistent, responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript for type safety and performance.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM; Redis for caching.
- **Message Broker**: Kafka for event-driven sync.
- **Analytics**: Elasticsearch for real-time metrics.
- **Integrations**: Twilio (calls), Shopify/Square (inventory), Google Calendar (appointments).
- **Deployment**: Cloud (AWS/GCP) with Kubernetes for orchestration, CI/CD (Jenkins/GitHub Actions), monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana).

## Implementation Plan

This plan is broken into actionable phases based on the SRS, HLD, and LLD. Each phase builds on the previous one, starting with setup and progressing to deployment. Estimated timeline assumes a 2-3 developer team; adjust based on resources.

1. **Project Setup (1-2 weeks)**:

   - Initialize repositories (monorepo with backend/frontend folders).
   - Set up Node.js/TypeScript backend with Express, Prisma, and dependencies (e.g., Kafka client, Elasticsearch client, JWT).
   - Set up React frontend with MUI, WebSocket client (Socket.io), and build tools (e.g., Vite).
   - Configure environment variables, Docker for containerization, and CI/CD pipelines.

2. **Authentication & Security Module (1 week)**:

   - Implement JWT-based auth with RBAC (roles: admin, staff, executive).
   - Add middleware for session management and input validation.
   - Integrate OAuth2 for external APIs (e.g., Shopify).

3. **Database & Schema Setup (1 week)**:

   - Design and implement Prisma schema (models: User, Location, Customer, Call, Metric).
   - Set up PostgreSQL instance, migrations, and indexes for performance.
   - Seed initial data for testing.

4. **Data Synchronization Module (1-2 weeks)**:

   - Implement event-driven sync using Kafka (producer/consumer).
   - Handle conflicts with last-write-wins strategy.
   - Add retry logic for failures (up to 3 attempts).

5. **Intelligent Call Routing Module (1-2 weeks)**:

   - Integrate Twilio for incoming calls via webhooks.
   - Use Redis for caching staff availability/status.
   - Implement rule-based scoring for expertise matching.

6. **Automation Module (1-2 weeks)**:

   - Build adapters for 3rd-party APIs (Shopify for inventory, Google Calendar for appointments).
   - Add request parsing for intent detection (e.g., "check inventory for item X").
   - Handle API errors with retries and fallbacks.

7. **Real-Time Analytics Module (1-2 weeks)**:

   - Set up Elasticsearch for log aggregation.
   - Implement queries for metrics (e.g., AHT, resolution rate).
   - Add WebSocket pushes for dashboard updates (<10s refresh).

8. **Frontend Dashboard Development (2-3 weeks)**:

   - Build React components (e.g., CallQueue, AnalyticsChart) with MUI theming.
   - Implement responsive design for desktop/mobile.
   - Integrate WebSockets for live data.

9. **Integration & Testing (2-3 weeks)**:

   - Wire modules together (e.g., API gateways, message brokers).
   - Set up Playwright for unit/component tests and E2E flows.
   - Perform load testing (stress to 2x expected load) and security audits.

10. **Deployment & Monitoring (1-2 weeks)**:
    - Deploy to cloud (e.g., AWS ECS/Kubernetes) with auto-scaling.
    - Configure monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry for errors).
    - Set up production environments and rollback plans.

### Risks & Mitigations

- **Integration Delays**: Use mock services for early testing; conduct pre-implementation audits.
- **Scalability Issues**: Start with cloud auto-scaling; load test early.
- **Security Breaches**: Implement AES-256 encryption; regular audits.
- **User Resistance**: Provide training and A/B test UI for usability.

### Next Steps

- Start with project setup to establish the foundation.
- Prioritize high-priority features (FR-01 to FR-05 from SRS).
- If you need prototypes (e.g., for automation), I can help build a demo module.

This plan aligns with the BRD/SRS priorities and HLD/LLD designs.
