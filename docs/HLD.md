## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This High-Level Design (HLD) document builds upon the SRS by providing an architectural blueprint for Call Commander. It outlines the system's structure, components, data flows, and high-level module designs to guide the development team. The focus is on ensuring scalability, security, and alignment with business requirements, such as unifying communications without complex setups. Detailed low-level designs (e.g., code-level specifics) will follow in a separate LLD document if needed.

### 1.2 Scope

- **In Scope**: Overall system architecture, module breakdowns, database schema, API endpoints, UI wireframes (textual descriptions), and non-functional aspects.
- **Out of Scope**: Detailed code implementations, unit test cases, deployment scripts (to be covered in LLD or implementation phases).

### 1.3 Design Overview

Call Commander is designed as a microservices-based SaaS application deployed on the cloud. It emphasizes modularity for easy scaling, real-time processing via event-driven architecture, and seamless integrations. The design ensures low-latency operations (<2s for key actions) and supports multi-tenancy for different retail chains.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Components

The system is divided into the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Web/Mobile UI (Dashboard) – Handles user interactions.
- **Application Layer**: Business logic modules (e.g., Routing, Automation) – Processes requests.
- **Data Layer**: Databases and caches – Stores and retrieves data.
- **Integration Layer**: APIs and connectors – Links to external systems (e.g., phone providers, CRMs).
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Cloud services – For hosting, scaling, and monitoring.

Key Components:

- **Frontend**: React.js app for responsive dashboard.
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python (FastAPI) microservices.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational) + Redis (caching for real-time data).
- **Message Broker**: Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven sync and routing.
- **Analytics Engine**: Elasticsearch for metrics querying.

### 2.2 Data Flow Diagram

(Textual representation; in practice, use tools like Lucidchart for visuals.)

High-Level Data Flow:

1. User logs in → Authentication Service verifies → Session granted.
2. Incoming Call (from external phone system via API) → Routing Service analyzes availability/expertise → Routes to staff device.
3. Data Update (e.g., customer record) → Sync Service broadcasts via message broker → Updates all locations' databases/caches.
4. Automation Trigger (e.g., inventory check) → Automation Service queries integrated API → Returns response.
5. Analytics Request → Analytics Service aggregates from logs → Displays in dashboard.

ASCII Art Representation:

```
[External Systems (Phone/CRM/Inventory)]
          ↑↓ (APIs/Webhooks)
[API Gateway] ←→ [Authentication Service]
                  ↓
[Frontend Dashboard] ←→ [Backend Microservices: Sync, Routing, Automation, Analytics]
                  ↓
[Message Broker] ←→ [Database (PostgreSQL + Redis)]
                  ↓
[Monitoring/Logging (e.g., ELK Stack)]
```

### 2.3 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Material-UI for components, WebSockets for real-time updates.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI for APIs; Docker for containerization.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (main), Redis (cache), MongoDB (if unstructured logs needed).
- **Integration**: RESTful APIs, Webhooks (e.g., Twilio for calls).
- **DevOps**: AWS/GCP for cloud, Kubernetes for orchestration, CI/CD with Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
- **Security**: JWT for auth, OAuth for integrations.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, Sentry for errors.

## 3. Module Designs

### 3.1 Unified Dashboard Module

- **Purpose**: Central UI for all features.
- **Components**: Navigation bar, tabs for Calls/Data/Analytics, real-time widgets.
- **Interactions**: Fetches data via APIs; subscribes to WebSockets for updates.
- **Design Pattern**: MVC (Model-View-Controller).

### 3.2 Data Synchronization Module

- **Purpose**: Real-time data consistency across locations.
- **Components**: Sync Engine (listens to events), Conflict Resolver (handles merges).
- **Flow**: Event → Broker → Sync to replicas.
- **Design Pattern**: Event-Driven Architecture.

### 3.3 Intelligent Call Routing Module

- **Purpose**: Dynamic call assignment.
- **Components**: Rules Engine (availability checks), Load Balancer.
- **Flow**: Incoming metadata → Query staff status → Route via SIP/WebRTC.
- **Design Pattern**: Rule-Based System.

### 3.4 Automation Module

- **Purpose**: Handle routine tasks.
- **Components**: Workflow Orchestrator, Integration Adapters.
- **Flow**: Parse request → Execute API call (e.g., inventory) → Respond.
- **Design Pattern**: Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda for scalability).

### 3.5 Real-Time Analytics Module

- **Purpose**: Metrics visualization.
- **Components**: Data Aggregator, Chart Renderer.
- **Flow**: Stream logs → Aggregate in Elasticsearch → Query and display.
- **Design Pattern**: Stream Processing.

### 3.6 Security and Authentication Module

- **Purpose**: Protect access and data.
- **Components**: Auth Server (RBAC), Encryption Service.
- **Flow**: Login → Token issuance → Validate on each request.

## 4. Database Design

### 4.1 Entity-Relationship Diagram

(Textual ERD; visualize with dbdiagram.io in practice.)

Entities:

- User (user_id PK, role, location_id FK, name, email)
- Location (location_id PK, name, address)
- Customer (customer_id PK, name, contact, history JSON)
- Call (call_id PK, timestamp, status, routed_to_user_id FK, customer_id FK)
- Metric (metric_id PK, type, value, timestamp, call_id FK)

Relationships:

- User 1:M Call (handles)
- Location 1:M User (assigned)
- Customer 1:M Call (involves)

### 4.2 Schema Details

- Tables normalized to 3NF.
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., timestamp for analytics).
- Sharding by location_id for scalability.

## 5. API Design

### 5.1 Key Endpoints

- **Auth**: POST /login – Returns JWT.
- **Sync**: POST /sync/customer/{id} – Triggers data sync.
- **Routing**: POST /route/call – Handles incoming call routing.
- **Automation**: GET /automate/inventory?item=xyz – Returns status.
- **Analytics**: GET /analytics?metric=call_performance&range=last_7d – Returns JSON data.
- All endpoints use HTTPS, rate-limited.

### 5.2 Integration Points

- Phone: Webhooks from Twilio/Vonage.
- CRM: OAuth to Salesforce/HubSpot.
- Inventory: REST to Shopify/Square.

## 6. UI/UX Design

### 6.1 Wireframe Descriptions

- **Login Screen**: Simple form with email/password, forgot password link.
- **Dashboard Home**: Sidebar nav; central panel with real-time call queue, quick stats widgets.
- **Analytics Page**: Filterable charts (bar/line for metrics), export button.
- **Mobile View**: Responsive; hamburger menu for nav.

(For actual wireframes, use Figma/Balsamiq; here, textual for illustration.)

### 6.2 User Flow

1. Login → Home Dashboard.
2. Handle Call: Notification → View details → Route/Automate.
3. View Analytics: Select filters → Refresh data.

## 7. Non-Functional Design Considerations

- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling via microservices; auto-scaling groups.
- **Performance**: Caching for frequent reads; optimized queries.
- **Security**: Encryption at rest/transit; regular audits.
- **Reliability**: Redundant databases; circuit breakers for integrations.
- **Usability**: WCAG-compliant; A/B testing planned.

## 8. Assumptions and Risks

- **Assumptions**: Stable third-party APIs; sufficient cloud credits.
- **Risks**: Integration delays – Mitigate with mock services.
- **Dependencies**: SRS approvals; access to design tools.

## 9. Appendices

- **Traceability**: All designs trace back to SRS reqs (e.g., FR-02 → Sync Module).
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to Low-Level Design (LLD) or prototyping.

This HLD provides a solid foundation for implementation. If you need more details (e.g., specific diagrams via code generation) or adjustments, let me know. Otherwise, we can move to prototyping or LLD.
